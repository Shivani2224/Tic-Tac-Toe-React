# React Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React to practice and demonstrate fundamental concepts of the library, including component-based architecture, state management, and handling user events.

## Project Goal
The primary objective of this project was to solidify my understanding of core React principles by building a small but complete application from scratch. It serves as a practical example of how to manage a game's state and conditionally render components.

## Features
*   **Classic Gameplay**: Play a standard Tic-Tac-Toe game on a 3x3 board.
*   **Turn-Based Logic**: Correctly switches between "X" and "O" players.
*   **Winning Conditions**: Automatically detects and announces a winner when three marks are aligned horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
*   **Draw Detection**: Displays a "Draw" message if all squares are filled and no winner is found.
*   **Reset Functionality**: Allows players to restart the game at any point.

## Technologies Used
*   **React**: The core JavaScript library for building the user interface.
*   **JavaScript**: For implementing game logic, state management, and event handling.
*   **HTML**: For the game's structure.
*   **CSS**: For styling the game board and components.
